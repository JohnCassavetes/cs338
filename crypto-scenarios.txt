1. 
Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret from which they derive an AES key K, 
then Alice encrypts the long message M with using AES with the shared key K, and sends it to Bob.

2. 
Alice does H(M) and encrypts it with her S_A key and sends it to Bob. 
if Bob's decryption of H(M) is the same as Alice's H(M), it has not been modified.

3. 
Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret from which they derive an AES key K, 
then Alice encrypts the long message M with using AES with the shared key K, 
does H(M) and encrypts it with her S_A key and sends it to Bob. 

4.
Claim 1: Someone intercepted the contract. Low possibility, because the hash would be different.
Claim 2: Bob found Alice's secret key and made changes to the contract. Medium possibilty, needs more evidence if Bob has ever stolen or done some bad stuff. 
Claim 3: Alice sent the wrong contract by accident. High possibility, human error.


5. 
Sig_CA = E(S_CA, H(M))

6. 
Bob provides M and Sig_B, so that M||Sig_B and Sig_B = E(S_B, H(M)). 
Alice does H(M) uses P_B, E(P_B, Sig_B) so that she can validate Bob's legitimacy. 

7. 
a. Mal obtaining the CA's secret key, which allows her to create her own trusted certificates. 
b. Mal obtains Bob's secret key and provides a signature that is legitimate but not actually from Bob.
