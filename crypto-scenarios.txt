1. 
Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret from which they derive an AES key K, 
then Alice encrypts the long message M with using AES with the shared key K, and sends it to Bob.

2. 
Alice does H(M) and encrypts it with her S_A key and sends it to Bob. 
if Bob's decryption of H(M) is the same as Alice's H(M), it has not been modified.

3. 
Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret from which they derive an AES key K, 
then Alice encrypts the long message M with using AES with the shared key K, 
does H(M) and encrypts it with her S_A key and sends it to Bob. 

4.


5. 
Sig_CA = E(S_CA, H(M)) where M is a random message. 

6. 
Bob provides M and Sig_B, so that M||Sig_B and Sig_B = E(S_B, H(M)). 
Alice does H(M) uses P_B, E(P_B, Sig_B) so that she can validate Bob's legitimacy. 

7. 
a. Mal obtaining the CA's secret key, which allows her to create her own trusted certificates. 
b. Mal obtains Bob's secret key and provides a signature that is legitimate but not actually from Bob.
