d. Yes
e. Using Cookies
f. The browser sends an HTTP GET request, and gets a response with a Set-Cookie header to update the theme of the cookie.
g. If you want red, change the url from http://cs338.jeffondich.com/fdf/ to http://cs338.jeffondich.com/fdf/?theme=red -- 
    basically just add "?theme=[theme that you want]" at the end of the url.
h. Intercept the request when you change the theme, then edit the 'Cookie: theme="[red or blue or default]"', then forward it.
i. In Cookie Jar. To access it go to Settings > Sessions > Open cookie jar.
